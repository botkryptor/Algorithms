/*
Samantha and Sam are playing a numbers game. Given a number as a string, no leading zeros, determine the sum of all integer values of substrings of the string. For example, if the string is , the substrings are  and . Their sum is .

Given an integer as a string, sum all of its substrings cast as integers. As the number may become large, return the value modulo .

Function Description

Complete the substrings function in the editor below. It should return the sum of the integer values of all substrings in a string representation of a number, modulo .

substrings has the following parameter(s):

n: the string representation of an integer
Input Format

A single line containing an integer as a string without leading zeros.

Constraints

Output Format

A single line which is sum of the substrings, 

Sample Input 0

16
Sample Output 0

23
Explanation 0

The substring of number 16 are 16, 1 and 6 which sums to 23.

Sample Input 1

123
Sample Output 1

164
Explanation 1

The sub-strings of 123 are 1, 2, 3, 12, 23, 123 which sums to 164.
